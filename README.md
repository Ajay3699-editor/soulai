Project Title : Soulmate.AGI 
Selected Domain : AIML
Problem Statement : 2. "SoulMate.AGI – A Personalized, Evolving Companion Trained by You, for
You".
Abstract : SoulMate.AGI is an advanced AI-based system designed to function as a lifelong, emotionally intelligent digital companion that evolves uniquely for each user. Focused on providing emotional support, companionship, and personalized interactions, SoulMate.AGI is particularly helpful for individuals experiencing loneliness, mental fatigue, or isolation. The system leverages Gemini AI API models as its foundational large language model (LLM) and integrates a dynamic self-learning framework that fine-tunes the model based on the user's daily interactions.

The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a clean, responsive, and intuitive frontend. It supports multimodal interaction—text-based chat, voice communication, and facial sentiment detection. Core features include Journaling Mode for emotional expression, Memory Recall for revisiting past conversations, and Daily Thought Summaries to reflect on mood patterns and mental well-being.

The backend is powered by FastAPI through a Python server script (server.py), which handles API requests, manages session data, and facilitates seamless communication with the Gemini LLM. This backend is responsible for processing user inputs, managing vector embeddings, performing tone analysis, and securely storing interaction data.

Every night, the system undergoes incremental cloud-based training using fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning). This allows the AGI to continuously learn and evolve by embedding new memories, understanding the user's preferences, and adapting its tone and conversational behavior without forgetting prior knowledge.

A robust Self-Evolving Personality Engine empowers the AI to mimic the user’s tone, remember contextual details, and adapt emotionally over time. Additional modules include a Loneliness Analyzer to detect emotional downturns, and a Wellness Mode offering affirmations, music, breathing exercises, and AI-generated storytelling. All sensitive user data is stored in an encrypted Private Memory Vault, ensuring privacy and personal ownership.

Through continuous learning, personalized interaction, and emotional intelligence, SoulMate.AGI transforms into a deeply meaningful digital companion—trained by the user, for the user.
